# nvim-conf

My config for neovim

## macos

Clone the repo to `~/.config/nvim` and install the following:
```
brew install nvim
brew install fd
brew install ripgrep
brew install stylua
brew install texlab
```

## ubuntu

Clone the repo to `~/.config/nvim`.

Install the following with apt:
```
sudo apt install fd-find
sudo apt install ripgrep
sudo apt install tree-sitter-cli
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
sudo apt install python3-venv
```

I haven't looked into installing `stylua` yet.
